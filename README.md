# t_bot_weather
<b>HELLO WORLD!!!</b>

I'm learning python and this is my first small practical repository.

<em>This project will help you find out the current weather upon request from user in a telegram bot, just write the city.
After you write the city you will receive a weather report. In the inline keyboard appears, you can select 
a category (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) as well as a full report. All this within one inline keyboard
that will edit text after pressing a button.</em>
